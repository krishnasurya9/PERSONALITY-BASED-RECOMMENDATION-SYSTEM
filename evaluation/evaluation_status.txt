=== 7. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ===

Based on the validation analysis, here are possible explanations for the high performance:

1. Data characteristics:
   - Is there a strong correlation between specific words/patterns and personality traits?
   - Are the labels too consistent for identical prompts?

2. Model behavior:
   - How does the trained model compare to random initialization?
   - Does a simpler model achieve similar results with minimal training?

3. Cross-validation reliability:
   - Are results consistent across different data splits?
   - Does random weight initialization still yield high accuracy?

Recommended next steps:
1. If trained model significantly outperforms random, the model is learning real patterns
2. If the simpler model achieves similar results, consider using it for efficiency
3. If duplicate/correlated data is found, clean the dataset and retest
4. Consider external validation with a completely different dataset
5. Implement additional regularization techniques if overfitting is suspected
